# JsonConverter

This project is a using a JSON parsing library to serialize data from the file located in: JsonConverter/dane.csv while omitting any duplicate records and logging invalid lines in log.txt created in the bin\Debug\net7.0 folder

# HOW_TO_RUN
I recommend using Visual Studio 2022 and copy this repository, then build the project

For the default .csv path to work make sure to put it inside \bin\Debug\net7.0 folder created during the build process
